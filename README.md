# travellingWaveEEG
matlab code to analyze EEG travelling wave data

the data used in the code are available at:
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7i3m3862w0b37x6/AABy8l0YeQhkutOG3sGCb6Xka?dl=0

startingFunction() is the pipeline. 
First part load the data, the other three parts analyze different dataset. Indeed, there are 3 datasets: Echoes, Input & Closed.
Please for details refer to the paper "Alpha oscillations and travelling waves: signatures of predictive coding?" by Andrea Alamia & Rufin VanRullen
