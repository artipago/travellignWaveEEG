# travellingWaveEEG
matlab code to analyze EEG travelling wave data

the data used in the code are available at:
https://osf.io/nc4rg/?view_only=bb06fe996d1f49b285dc25464eec7ac7

startingFunction() is the pipeline. 
First part load the data, the other three parts analyze different dataset. 
There are indeed 3 datasets: Echoes, Input & Closed.

Please for details refer to the paper "Alpha oscillations and travelling waves: signatures of predictive coding?" by Andrea Alamia & Rufin VanRullen
